# VerilogBlockTesting

Repository sharing some of the Verilog testbenches made with my mate Iatrakis Ioannis for the Microprocessors Course lab homework (Prof. Vasileios Tenentes).

Modules for the simple RISC-V CPU were supplied in the lab resources and we had to implement modifications and write new testbenches for the modified modules.
